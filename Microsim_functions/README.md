# Microsim_functions

This folder contains functions in R scripts for performing microsimulations in R. The codes are based on the tutorial paper by Krijkamp EM et al. 2018 [https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989X18754513](https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989X18754513) and their R codes can be found in [https://github.com/DARTH-git/Microsimulation-tutorial](https://github.com/DARTH-git/Microsimulation-tutorial).
